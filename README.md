# College-Info-System
Old OOPHP Project Code

College Info System(part of Colmation MIS) [One of my Oldest project from India (like 2010 or so)]

This module is from one of the earliest project Colmation that I worked on. I have removed images and certain scripts since they were creating problems while uploading content.
The code takes care of user validation and verification. It used PHP-LDAP to connect to the LDAP server. It allows student and staff to update their information to MySQL server. The project also uses PHP5, MySQL 5.0, HTML4, AJAX, CSS, jQuery UI & JavaScript.

NOTE: The coding skill in "college_info" is not on par with current standards since I was a newbie (first or second year of my career) when I worked on it therefore it does not represent my current skill level. I have shared this project as I cannot share code from any of my recent project in US as it will breach confidentiality clause. Another reason I shared it was since it was a good example displaying my familiarity with OOPHP and MySQL.
